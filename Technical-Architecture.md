  - Cross-campaign aggregation (total spend, impressions, clicks, conversions)
  - Performance ratios (CTR, CPA, ROAS, frequency)
  - Multi-KPI scoring algorithm for campaign ranking
- **Performance Segmentation**:
  - Top performer identification (multi-weighted scoring: ROAS 40%, CTR 25%, CPA 20%, CPC 10%, Frequency 5%)
  - Ad fatigue detection (frequency ≥ 3.0 threshold)
  - Demographic performance analysis with minimum impression thresholds

### 5. AI Analysis Engine
- **Primary AI Model**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet for advanced campaign analysis

### 6. Data Merge & Orchestration Layer
- **Merge Node**: Synchronizes statistical data with AI analysis outputs
- **Data Flow Control**: Ensures proper sequencing between calculation and analysis phases
- **State Management**: Maintains data integrity across parallel processing branches

### 7. Report Generation Engine
- **Dynamic HTML Email Composer**: JavaScript-based report generation
  - Responsive email template with embedded CSS styling
  - Real-time metric visualization with performance indicators
  - Conditional alert rendering based on fatigue thresholds
  - Multi-format data presentation (tables, metrics cards, analysis sections)
- **Content Personalization**: Dynamic subject line generation with performance flags

### 8. Multi-Channel Output Layer
- **Email Distribution**: Gmail SMTP integration with HTML formatting
  - Automated recipient management
  - Performance-based subject line optimization
  - Rich formatting with visual indicators and alerts
- **Data Persistence**: Google Sheets export for historical tracking
  - Automated append operations to AI_Analysis_Results sheet
  - 10-column structured data logging with timestamp tracking
  - Top performer serialization with performance metrics
